# SynchroniseSIM 2025
Simulation of Sychronising a Generator to the electrical grid

## Introduction

The aim is to synchronise the turbine/generator to the 50Hz grid with
the minimal disturbance to the machine or the grid system.
The key to receiving a good score is to ensure the voltage, freqency and
phase angle of the incoming machine is equal to the voltage, frequency
and phase angle of the electrical grid at the moment the CB (circuit breaker)
is closed. To achieve a perfect score of 100% may require a few attempts.
